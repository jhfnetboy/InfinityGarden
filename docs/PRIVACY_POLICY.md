# Privacy Policy for XGarden

**Last Updated:** November 21, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how XGarden ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our Chrome extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

XGarden is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your conversations and creative worlds belong to you.

*   **No Analytics:** We do not use Google Analytics or any other third-party analytics software to track your usage.
*   **No Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history or online activities.
*   **No Account Required:** You do not need to create an account with us to use the extension.

## 2. Local Data Storage

All data generated by XGarden is stored locally on your device using your browser's storage capabilities (`chrome.storage.local` and IndexedDB). This includes:

*   **Chat History:** Your conversations with AI characters.
*   **World Data:** The worlds, characters, and lore you create.
*   **Settings:** Your configuration preferences, including API keys.

This data never leaves your browser unless you explicitly choose to export it. You have full control over this data and can clear it at any time by uninstalling the extension or using the "Clear Data" option in the settings.

## 3. Third-Party Services (AI Models)

XGarden acts as a client interface that allows you to interact with third-party Artificial Intelligence (AI) models (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) and Image Generation APIs.

*   **API Keys:** You are required to provide your own API keys to use these services. Your API keys are stored securely in your browser's local storage and are **never** sent to our servers.
*   **Data Transmission:** When you send a message or generate an image, the text of your prompt and necessary context (such as character descriptions) are sent directly from your browser to the respective third-party API provider (e.g., Google's servers for Gemini).
*   **Privacy Policies of Third Parties:** The handling of your data by these third-party services is governed by their respective privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of the AI provider you choose to use.
    *   [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## 4. Permissions

XGarden requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:

*   **`storage`**: To save your chat history, worlds, and settings locally on your device.
*   **`unlimitedStorage`**: To ensure you have enough space to store your creative worlds and long conversation histories.
*   **`activeTab`** (Optional): May be used only if specific features require interacting with the current page content (currently not primarily used for data collection).

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## 6. Contact Us
